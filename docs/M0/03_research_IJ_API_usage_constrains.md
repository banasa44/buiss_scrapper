## 3) [RESEARCH] Review InfoJobs API usage constraints

**Objective:** Identify any usage/storage constraints that could affect how we persist and export data.

**Key considerations:**

- Any restrictions on storing offer content and for how long.
- Any restrictions on redistribution or downstream use (e.g., exporting to Sheets, internal use only).
- Any required attribution or compliance notes.
- Any “must-do” items (headers, user-agent, app identification) from the docs.

**Desired output:**

- A short summary of constraints relevant to the MVP with “do” / “don’t” statements we can follow during implementation.
